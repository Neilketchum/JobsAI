```bash
git clone <repository-url> (https://github.com/Neilketchum/JobsAI)
cd jobs.ai
```

### 2. Frontend Setup

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables if the file dont exist:
```env
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000
REACT_APP_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_client_id
```

### 3. Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the backend directory:
```bash
cd backend
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Create a `.env` file in the backend directory with the following variables:
```env
PORT=5000
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_client_id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_google_client_secret
```

## Running the Application

### 1. Start the Backend Server

1. Navigate to the backend directory:
```bash
cd backend
```

2. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```
The backend server will start on http://localhost:5000

### 2. Start the Frontend Application

1. Open a new terminal window
2. Navigate to the project root directory:
```bash
cd jobs.ai
```

3. Start the React development server:
```bash
npm start
```
The frontend application will start on http://localhost:3000

## Accessing the Application

1. Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000
2. You should see the Jobs.AI application interface

## Available Scripts

### Frontend Scripts
- `npm start`: Runs the app in development mode
- `npm run build`: Builds the app for production
- `npm test`: Launches the test runner
- `npm run eject`: Ejects from Create React App

### Backend Scripts
- `npm start`: Runs the server in production mode
- `npm run dev`: Runs the server in development mode with hot reloading

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Port Already in Use**
   - If port 3000 or 5000 is already in use, you can change the port in the respective `.env` files

2. **MongoDB Connection Issues**
   - Ensure MongoDB is running
   - Verify the connection string in the backend `.env` file

3. **Missing Dependencies**
   - If you encounter missing module errors, try:
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```
   - For backend dependencies:
     ```bash
     cd backend
     npm install
     ```

4. **Environment Variables**
   - Ensure all required environment variables are set in both `.env` files
   - Double-check the values for accuracy

## Development Notes

- The frontend uses React with Material-UI for the interface
- The backend is built with Express.js
- MongoDB is used as the database
- Authentication is handled using JWT and Google OAuth
- PDF processing is handled using various PDF libraries
- OpenAI integration is used for AI-powered features
